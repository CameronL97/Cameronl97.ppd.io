My name is Cameron Leighton, I'm 22 years old from Silsden, West Yorkshire.
I completed my undergraduate degree in Physical Geography and Geology at The University of Leeds and I graduated in 2018.
I took a year out before coming back to do an Msc in River Basin Dynamics and Management with GIS.
During my degree I undertook a python coding module learning the basics of coding in python and writing in both markdown and hmtl. 

This website was created as part of a personal professional development module.
